/*
For this project I downlated Spotify data from mt Break Into Tech Course.
Then I created a tacle to insert Spotify data into.
Finally, I came up with questions and performed analytics on the data using SQL to answer said questions.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

SELECT * FROM Spotifydata;
-- What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, track_name as Song, avg(danceability) as Danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Song
Order by Artist;

-- Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY BIT_DB.Spotifydata.popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

-- What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, duration_ms as songLength
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY BIT_DB.Spotifydata.duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1;

-- What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, popularity, avg(duration_ms) as AVG_songLength
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Artist
ORDER BY BIT_DB.Spotifydata.popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

-- What artist has the fastest songs on average?
SELECT artist_name as Artist, avg(tempo) as Tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY tempo desc
Limit 1;

-- What artist(s) have the most songs ranked in the top 50?
SELECT artist_name AS Artist, count(artist_name) AS number_of_songs_in_top_50
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY Artist;
